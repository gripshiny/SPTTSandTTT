TTS Engine Selection: Choose a robust TTS engine that supports OSC and aligns with your project requirements. Thoroughly research available options, considering factors such as voice quality, language support, licensing, and OSC compatibility.

OSC Server Setup: Set up an OSC server that acts as a communication channel between your TTS engine and VRChat. This involves configuring the server with appropriate settings, such as port number and network connectivity.

OSC Message Structure: Define the OSC message structure that your TTS engine expects to receive. Specify the required parameters, such as the text input, voice selection, and other optional settings like pitch, speed, or volume.
Audio Integration: Implement the necessary mechanisms to handle the generated speech audio within VRChat. This may involve converting the TTS output to an audio format compatible with VRChat, managing audio playback, and synchronizing it with the appropriate visual elements in your virtual environment.

Testing and Refinement: Thoroughly test your TTS application, checking for proper OSC message transmission, accurate speech synthesis, and seamless integration with VRChat. Refine the implementation as needed, addressing any issues or enhancing the user experience.
